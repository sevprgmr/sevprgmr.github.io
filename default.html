C.
    Hood --- I'm an Information and Engineering Technology Professional. I have
    over 25 years of experience with two (2) trational four(4) year degrees: One in
    Computer Science from <a href="http://www.lipscomb.edu/">Lipscomb University</a>
    and the second in Engineering Technology from <a href="http://www.mtsu.edu/">
        Middle
        Tennessee State University
    </a>. I provide comprehensive Computer Hardware and
    Software Services to everyone. I began my career with <a href="http://www.jacobstechnology.com/">Sverdrup Technology</a> at <a href="http://www.arnold.af.mil/">Arnold Air Force Station</a>, TN as a
    Programmer Analyst where I supported the Air Force's jet and rocket test
    operations by developing data acquisition software for radiometers,
    spectrometers, ultra violent infrared cameras along with data analysis graphics
    in Sverdrup's Propulsion Diagnostic Group. I was transferred to <a href="http://www.ssc.nasa.gov/public/visitors/">Stennis Space Center</a> after
    Challenger and became part of <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>'s team
    that test certified all Space Shuttle Main Engines in Mississippi. I have
    extensive web development and database development expertise, including .Net
    applications with linked in SQL Data Base applications. I'm also a trained
    instrument electronics technician and can develop hardware and software
    projects from scratch. After Stennis, I worked in Oak Ridge for Bechlet
    National as an <a href="http://www.oracle.com/index.html">Oracle</a> Developer.
    I supported the <a href="http://www.energy.gov/">Department of Energy</a> there
    creating customized budget tracking reports with Oracle and Synergy. I have
    over 15 years of training in Spectroscopy and Sensor development. When my work
    @ Oak Ridge was complete I went to work for Nova Computer Systems in Nashville,
    TN as their Lead Programmer. I developed Data Acquisition Systems for all kinds
    of racecars, motorcycles and boats, but our specialty was Round-Track. I was on
    the breaking edge of Winston Cup testing. I also supported Nova's sister
    company, Interstate Freight Auditing Company as their UNIX System Administrator
    and Lead Programmer, who's applications were strictly business. I'm <a href="http://www.comptia.org/">CompTIA</a> A+ and Network+ Certified. I
    am currently working for Intervalidate, LLC, developing ASP.Net Microsoft
    Visual Studio, Microsoft Visual Code, C#, MS Sql Server, MySql Websites. I have
	plans to persue a Masters of Science in Computer Science at MTSU and I am on
	my way to being a Full-Stack-Developer.</p>
